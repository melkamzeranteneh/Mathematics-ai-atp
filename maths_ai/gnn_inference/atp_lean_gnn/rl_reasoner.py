"""Training-mode search: on-policy sampling expansion over the hybrid reasoner.

``RLHybridReasoner`` overrides these seams of ``HybridReasoner``:

  * ``predict_next_tactic`` / ``predict_next_tactics_batch`` — instead of the
    deterministic GNN-engine top-k, draw ``k`` i.i.d. actions from the actor-critic
    policy (``model.act``), decode each into a ``TacticCandidate`` the Pantograph
    executor can apply, and stash the integer action record (``EdgeAction``) in the
    proposing node's pending sub-dict. The batch variant runs one multi-graph policy
    forward across all leaves of a simulation batch.
  * ``_link`` — when the executor accepts a candidate and the base expansion links it
    into the hypergraph, migrate the stash entry from the pending sub-dict to
    ``edge.id`` so the train phase can join each harvested transition to the action
    that produced it.
  * ``_leaf_value`` — the critic head's value estimate for an unresolved simulation
    leaf (HTPS's ``v_T(g) = c_θ(g)``), used by ``_backup_simulation``.

The pending stash is keyed per node (``goal_key → {fingerprint → EdgeAction}``): a
node's still-pending entries after its expansion completes belong to executor-REJECTED
samples, and ``_on_expansion_complete`` flushes exactly that node's sub-dict to
``failure_actions`` — so batching proposals across several leaves cannot misattribute
one leaf's pending entries to another. Failure records train the actor with
``return = terminal_failure − step_penalty`` (no critic target — the state may still be
provable, only that action failed).

Only integers are stashed (no autograd graph): the train phase recomputes log-probs under
the current parameters via ``model.evaluate_actions``, which is exactly on-policy under the
one-optimizer-step-per-collect invariant.
