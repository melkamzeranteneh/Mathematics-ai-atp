"""Self-contained model bundles: weights plus the vocabularies that give them meaning.

A training checkpoint is not a publishable model.  :func:`_save_checkpoint`
stores weights and a config, and that config names the prepared dataset root by
*filesystem path*; the vocabularies themselves live under that root.  Node IDs
index the label embedding and tactic IDs index the classifier, and both are
assigned by position in a sorted set -- see ``build_vocab_from_labels`` in
``pyg.py`` and ``build_tactic_vocab`` in ``labels.py`` -- so a vocabulary
rebuilt from a different set of rows renumbers everything after the first
difference.  When the renumbered vocabulary happens to have the same length the
weights still load, the service still starts, and the model answers confidently
with the wrong labels.

A bundle removes both failures at once.  It ships the vocabularies next to the
weights and records the SHA-256 of each, so the binding is verified against
content instead of trusted because a path happened to resolve.  And it can be
loaded with no prepared dataset present, which is what lets a published model
be served from the model artifacts alone.

Layout of one bundle directory::

    bundle.json          manifest: model_type, hashes, provenance
    config.json          architecture, with training-machine paths redacted
    model.safetensors    weights only; no optimizer state
    summary.json         final validation metrics (copied from the run, optional)
    metrics.jsonl        per-epoch history (copied from the run, optional)

The vocabularies are resolved from the bundle directory first and then from a
sibling ``vocab/`` directory, so a repository of several bundles can share one
canonical copy while a bundle exported with ``self_contained=True`` still works
when it is moved out on its own.
